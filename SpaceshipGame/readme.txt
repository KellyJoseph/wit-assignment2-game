Instructions:
To move left, press the "w" key.
To move right, press the "s" key.
To shoot, press the "j" key.
To reset the game, press the "r" key.

You have three lives, you must clear the entire wave within a life to defeat the aliens.
If an alien reaches your base, then you lose a life and the wave resets. If you lose three
lives, then the game is over!

This game is a space invaders clone. It differs from the real game in that the aliens do not shoot back, and nor are there shields which are gradually destroyed
as they are shot by aliens or the player.

How this game met the assignment requirements:

"The aim of the assignment is for you to demonstrate your understanding of all the structures seen so far. Specifically, you are asked to include the following:

At least one user-defined class, adhering to encapsulation rules, complete with:
        fields
        constructors
        getters
        setters
        other methods"

My game has 5 classes, all of which have getters, setters, and these are used from the main method for calculations.
    "The usual Processing class containing the draw(), setup(), etc. This class must use your user-defined class(es) in an appropriate manner." -->> see main class

    Use of selection (if) and iteration (loops). -->> These are used extensively for animating the enemies, bullets, determining if enemies are alive or dead, for
    collsion detection and more

    Use of primitive / object arrays. -->> ArrayLists are used for storing and drawing the enemy and bullet array objects.
