# wit-assignment2-game
Second assignment for programming fundamentals, make a game. Space invaders clone using processing
I made this game as a part of my introduction to programming course, about 6 weeks into learning Java
It's missing a lot of features from real space invaders, like enemies firing and shields, but it is
mechnically quite functional and controls quite responsively. It was designed in the Processing IDE.
